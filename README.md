# 🎨 Color Reflex Game

A fast-paced, eye-fooling color guessing game built with Python and Tkinter. 

## 🕹️ How It Works

This game tests how well your brain can handle conflicting information. A color name is displayed in one color... but you need to type the **color of the text**, *not* the word itself. Confused already? Perfect.

### Example

If you see:

```
Word: BLUE (but written in red)
```

You must type: `red` — not `blue`.

## 🧠 Skills Tested

- Reflexes
- Color perception
- Brain agility
- Your patience after you keep typing the wrong color

## 🛠️ Features

- Countdown timer (30 seconds of stress)
- Score tracker (watch your pride rise and fall)
- Random color shuffling every turn
- GUI with Tkinter

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter 

### Run It

Just hit enter and go. The game starts when you press the Enter key.

## ✨ How to Play

1. Start typing the **color of the word**, not the word itself.
2. Press `Enter` to begin and after each guess.
3. Try to beat your own high score before the timer hits zero.
4. Brag about it. Or rage-quit. Both are valid options.
