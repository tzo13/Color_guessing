# 🎨 Color Reflex Game

A fast-paced, eye-fooling color guessing game built with Python and Tkinter. Think you're quick? Think again.

## 🕹️ How It Works

This game tests how well your brain can handle conflicting information. A color name is displayed in one color... but you need to type the **color of the text**, *not* the word itself. Confused already? Perfect.

### Example

If you see:

```
Word: BLUE (but written in red)
```

You must type: `red` — not `blue`, smarty-pants.

## 🧠 Skills Tested

- Reflexes
- Color perception
- Brain agility
- Your patience after you keep typing the wrong color

## 🛠️ Features

- Countdown timer (30 seconds of stress)
- Score tracker (watch your pride rise and fall)
- Random color shuffling every turn
- GUI with Tkinter that doesn’t look like it came out of the 90s (ok maybe just a little)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python, unless your computer lives under a rock)

### Run It

```bash
python color.py
```

Just hit enter and go. The game starts when you press the Enter key.

## ✨ How to Play

1. Start typing the **color of the word**, not the word itself.
2. Press `Enter` to begin and after each guess.
3. Try to beat your own high score before the timer hits zero.
4. Brag about it. Or rage-quit. Both are valid options.

## 💡 Future Ideas

- High score saving
- Difficulty levels (aka more chaos)
- Sound effects (you know, for extra dopamine)
- Mobile version... one day. Maybe. Probably not.

## 🧼 Code Notes

- The main game logic is in `color.py`.
- Built with a simple GUI using Tkinter labels and entry fields.
- Uses the classic `<Return>` event binding to start the game and read input.
- Comments are half Greek, half English — bilingual power, baby.
